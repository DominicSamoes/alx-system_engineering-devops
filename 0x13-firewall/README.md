### [0. Block all incoming traffic but](./0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but)
* Let’s install the ufw firewall and setup a few rules on web-01.

* Requirements:

	- The requirements below must be applied to web-01 (feel free to do it on lb-01 and web-02, but it won’t be checked)
	- Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
		+ 22 (SSH)
		+ 443 (HTTPS SSL)
		+ 80 (HTTP)
	- Share the ufw commands that you used in your answer file
